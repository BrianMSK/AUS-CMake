A C++17 educational library implementing fundamental data structures, algorithms, and performance analysis tools. This project was developed as part of algorithms and data structures coursework, providing clean implementations of core computer science concepts.

## Overview

This library contains implementations of:

- **Data Structures**: Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Tables, Priority Queues
- **Algorithms**: Various sorting algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort, HeapSort, etc.)
- **Memory Management**: Custom memory managers with allocation tracking
- **Testing Framework**: Comprehensive test suites
- **Performance Analysis**: Complexity analyzers with timing and CSV output
